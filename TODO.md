## High Priority

- [ ] **API Optimization** - Cache submissions in JSON file each run to minimize API requests
- [ ] **netwrok error** - proper error hangling when connection aborted 

## Others

- [ ] **Hard Mode** - Remove users from list if they lose their streak
- [ ] **Streak Modes** - Add daily/weekly/monthly streak tracking options
- [ ] **Question Tracking** - Track specific accepted questions for each user
- [ ] **Aliasing** - set alias for users to show up in leader board instead of their cf handle
